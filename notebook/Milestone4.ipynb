    "You probably got how to set up primary URL endpoints from the ```sampleproject.ipynb notebook``` and have them process and return some data. Here we are going to create a new endpoint that accepts a POST request of the features required to run the machine learning model that you trained and saved in last milestone (i.e., a user will post the predictions of the 25 climate model rainfall predictions, i.e., features,  needed to predict with your machine learning model).

    "    \n",
    "    2.2 Or else you can make a file in your laptop called app.py and copy it over to your EC2 instance using ```scp```. Eg: ```scp -r -i \"ggeorgeAD.pem\" ~/Desktop/worker.py  ubuntu@ec2-xxx.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/```\n",
    "\n",

You have installed it in your TLJH using [Installing pip packages](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/howto/env/user-environment.html#installing-pip-packages). if you want to make it available to users outside of jupyterHub (which you want to in this case as we are logging into EC2 instance as user ```ubuntu``` by giving ```ssh -i privatekey ubuntu@<host_name>```) you can follow these [instructions](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/howto/env/user-environment.html#accessing-user-environment-outside-jupyterhub).\n",

We'll be using `screen`. `screen` will allow us to create a separate session within which we can run `flask` and which won't shut down when we exit the main shell session. Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "12. Feel free to exit your connection with the EC2 instance now and try accessing your service again with `curl`. You should find that the service has now persisted!\n",

    "In milestone 1, we attempted to clean and wrangle data for our model, but ran into speed issues locally depending on the machine that it was run on. We had issues with duplicating data through different iterations. Also, as part of this milestone we benchmarked each person’s computer when running the script to combine the data files.\n",

We moved the data to S3 bucket at the end of the milestone to store data. We also created logins for all users on Tiny Little Jupyter Hub (TLJH) so that we had the option to work individually. At this point, the data was ready to be applied to a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In milestone 3, we created our machine learning model on EC2 and then set up an EMR cluster which we accessed through `FoxyProxy Standard` in Firefox to help speed up hyperparameter optimization. Once we found the most optimal parameters, we applied those parameters to train and save the model to S3 in `joblib` format. \n",
    "\n",
    "In milestone 4, we developed and deployed the API to access the model from Milestone 3 using `Flask`. We developed the app on our EC2 instance on TLJH and after installing the required dependencies, deployed using `screen` to get a persistent session so that it does not end after we close the Terminal. Finally, we used this to perform a prediction on sample input, as seen on the screenshot below. \n"
